Models Used
1. Decision Tree Regressor
Captures non-linear relationships
Easy to interpret
Prone to overfitting without tuning

2. Random Forest Regressor
Ensemble of multiple decision trees
Reduces overfitting
Provides better generalisation and stability

Workflow
Data loading and inspection
Handling missing values (if any)
Feature–target split
Train–test split
Model training
Performance evaluation

Comparison of models
Evaluation Metrics
R² Score
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)

These metrics help assess both accuracy and error behaviour of the models.

Key Observations
Random Forest consistently outperformed Decision Tree in terms of prediction stability
Alcohol and sulphates showed a strong influence on wine quality
Ensemble learning helped reduce variance compared to a single tree
